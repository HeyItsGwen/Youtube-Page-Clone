# Youtube-Page-Clone
The first Microverse project, Basic HTML Page Structure, created by Ara and Gwen. 

This is a clone of a youtube page, to establish our HTML and CSS skills as part of the program. 

We practiced out HTML/CSS and gitflow skill, uploading to a feature branch to make sure code is complete and working before sending it to the master branch. We also got to start learning about the flow of pair programming through remote communication.
